Hello interviewer, 

I have built a solution to the test by formulating it as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). 
The exact code and implementation can be found in the ..//code_base//aurora_test.ipynb file. 

The detailed description as to how I have approached the problem is in the comments of the
python notebook file. 

In summary, the solution was built using MILP, assuming perfect price information, and traded on
a user-defined time-horizon. 

The key assumptions are as follows:
a. Degradation is negligible. 
b. Cycles equally spread across the lifetime of the battery. 
c. Battery is always operational, i.e., operating cost still persist regardless of battery operation.

The output of the code can be found in the ../results//results.csv file.

Closing remarks:
If this were to be used as a forward-looking tool, we need a forecast model. 


Requirements to run the solution:
- basic installation of anaconda
- pip install pyomo
